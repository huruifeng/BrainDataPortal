           The Parkinson’s Cell Atlas web portal is an open, interactive resource developed by the <strong><a href="https://donglab.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dong Lab</a> at the Adams Center for Parkinson’s Disease Research at Yale University</strong>, as part of <strong><a href="https://www.asapcrn.org/research-community/teams/scherzer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Team Scherzer</a></strong> within the Aligning Science Across Parkinson’s (ASAP) Collaborative Research Network (CRN).
           </p>
           <p>
            It provides access to a comprehensive, multi-dimensional atlas of the human brain in Parkinson’s disease (PD), integrating molecular, cellular, spatial, and clinical data across disease progression.
            </p>
            <p>
              This portal is designed to accelerate discovery by enabling researchers to explore, visualize, and analyze large-scale multi-omics datasets generated from postmortem human brain tissue. 
              By bringing together diverse data modalities into a unified platform, the resource supports hypothesis generation, cross-modal integration, and the identification of disease-relevant genes, pathways, and cell states.

          <h2>A Team Science Effort</h2>
          <p>
           The underlying PD5D dataset is generated through a collaborative effort led by <a href="https://www.asapcrn.org/research-community/teams/scherzer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Team Scherzer</a> as part of the Aligning Science Across Parkinson’s (ASAP) Collaborative Research Network (CRN).
           </p>
           <p>
            <a href="https://www.asapcrn.org/research-community/teams/scherzer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Team Scherzer</a> is a multidisciplinary consortium of investigators across institutions, combining expertise in genomics, neuroscience, computational biology, neuropathology, and clinical research. 
            Rather than representing the work of a single laboratory, this atlas reflects a <strong>team science approach</strong>, integrating contributions from multiple groups within the ASAP CRN and beyond.
            </p>
            <p>
            This collaborative framework enables the scale, depth, and rigor required to map Parkinson’s disease biology across:
            <ul>
              <li>Brain regions (spatial dimension)</li>
              <li>Cell types (cellular diversity)</li>
              <li>Disease stages (temporal progression)</li>
              <li>Molecular layers (multi-omics integration)</li>
            </ul>
            PD5D captures the molecular architecture of PD across five key dimensions—brain space, disease stage, and cell types, together with multi-omic regulatory layers.
            The datasets integrated into this portal include:
            <ul>
              <li>Single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq)</li>
              <li>Spatial transcriptomics</li>
              <li>Single-nucleus epigenomics (e.g., ATAC-seq)</li>
              <li>Genomic variation, including eQTL and caQTL analyses</li>
              <li>Clinical and neuropathological annotations</li>
            </ul>
            Together, these data enable a systems-level understanding of PD, from early vulnerability to advanced disease.
          </p>

        <div className="section">
          <h2>Purpose of the Portal</h2>
          This portal was developed to make PD5D data <strong>accessible, explorable, and reusable</strong> for the broader scientific community. Key goals include:
          <ul>
            <li>Democratizing access to large-scale PD brain datasets</li>
            <li>Enabling intuitive visualization of multi-omics data</li>
            <li>Supporting integrative and cross-modal analyses</li>
            <li>Accelerating identification of therapeutic targets and biomarkers</li>
          </ul>
          The platform is intended for neuroscientists, computational biologists, clinicians, and method developers studying Parkinson’s disease and related neurodegenerative disorders.

          <h2>Commitment to Open Science</h2>
          <p>
            In alignment with ASAP’s open science principles, all data and tools in this portal are shared to promote transparency, reproducibility, and collaboration.
            The portal is built on an open-source framework called <a href="https://github.com/TheDongLab/VizIt" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VizIt</a> developed by Dr. Ruifeng Hu and Christopher Zhang in Dong Lab at Yale:
            <ul>
              <li>Code repository:<a href="https://github.com/TheDongLab/VizIt" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> https://github.com/TheDongLab/VizIt</a></li>
              <li>Documentation: <a href="https://thedonglab.github.io/VizIt/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://thedonglab.github.io/VizIt/</a></li>
            </ul>
            We encourage the community to explore, reuse, and extend these resources to advance our collective understanding of Parkinson’s disease.
