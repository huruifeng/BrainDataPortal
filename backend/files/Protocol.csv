Nuclei_Isolation_v1,Nuclei Isolation and Sorting from Frozen Human Temporal Cortex,0.1,"human post-mortem medial temporal gyrus (MTG) tissue blocks were cro-sectioned (50µm) 
and lysed using Nuclei Pure lysis buffer.","Nuclei were purified in nuclei wash and resuspension buffer using multiple centrifugation
and 70µm and 40µm filtration. Isolated nuclei were then FACS sorted (Aria IIB). Singe nuclei were partitioned into GEM beads and barcoded with 10x genomiocs single cell 3' Gel Beads using 10x Chromium Controller","cDNA libaries were constructed using the 3' kit
and sequenced using Illumina NextSeq550","Raw sequencing data was downloaded from Illumina BaseSpace and preprocessed with cellRanger to generate fastq and reads count table. Downstream analysis for QC, cell clsutering, clsuter annotation, differential expression were done with Seurat and customized codes (see Github link).",https://github.com/NeurogenomicsLab/PD5D,dx.doi.org/10.17504/protocols.io.j8nlk4k55g5r/v1,https://cdn.10xgenomics.com/image/upload/v1660261285/support-documents/CG000204_ChromiumNextGEMSingleCell3_v3.1_Rev_D.pdf
